# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Titanic-dataset
In this case study, we will explore the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers who were on board the Titanic ship during its infamous maiden voyage in 1912.

### The goal of this case study is to answer the following questions:
### Q.1- How many rows and columns are there in the dataset?
### Q.2- In which class category more number of womenâ€™s died in terms of percentage of from that class?
### Q.3- Was the oldest passenger a male or a female?
### Q.4- What is the name of the oldest survived female passenger?
### Q.5- What are the details of the youngest passenger who did not survive?
### Q.6- What percentage of passengers overall survived the disaster?
### Q.7- Which sex of passengers were more on board?
### Q.8- Which passenger had the least average age by ticket class?
### Q.9- Which class had the highest fare?
### Q.10- Which class had the highest number of passengers?
We will use the Pandas library and Numpy in Python to load, manipulate, and analyze the Titanic dataset. We will also use data visualization tools to help us better understand the data and answer the questions posed above. Let's get started!
